## About The Project

<img src="/etch-a-sketch.gif">
<p> This is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. I Set up a “hover” effect so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through my grid like a pen would. When you click the button at the top of the screen, you can change numbers of squares per side to make the new grid. Once entered the new grid should be generated in the same total space as before and now you’ve got a new sketch pad.
